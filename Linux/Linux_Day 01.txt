Linux Commands_Part 1
+++++++++++++++++++++++
# To clear the screen
clear (or) control + l

# To see the current working location
pwd

# To see the current month 
cal (or) cal -1

# To see the current month, past month and upcoming month
cal -3

# To see the calendar of a complete year
cal <Year>

# To see the date
date

# To see from how long my server is up and running
uptime

# In Linux everything is represented as a File or a Directory

In Linux Directories are nothing but folders

# To see the files and directories available in the current location
ls			----> to see the list of files/directories
ls -l (or) ll	----> to see the detailed information (metadata) of the files and directories available

# To create a directory
mkdir <Dir.Name>

# How to identify a file or a directory
If you see "d" in the beginning of a line, when ll or ls -l is executed, that is a directory
If you see "-" in the beginning of a line, when ll or ls -l is executed, that is a file

# To go inside a specific directory
cd <Dir.Name> 

# To come out of a directory
cd ..
cd ../../..

# To delete an empty directory
rmdir <Dir.Name>

# To delete everything that is available inside a directory
rm -rf <Dir.Name>

# Creation of files in Linux
3 ways of creating files in Linux OS;
	1. touch
	2. cat
	3. vi (or) nano

# Creating an empty file
touch <FileName>.<Extension>

Note: If file extension is not given, Linux will consider such file as a normal file

kiran1.txt
kiran2.txt
kiran3.txt
.
.
.
kiran10.txt

touch kiran{1..10}.txt

# To remove a file
rm <FileName>

# To delete a specific type of files (eg; python files)
rm *.py

# To see the hidden files
ls -la

# To delete all the files available in the current location
rm -rf *

Note: We cannot delete the hidden files or directories

# Working with "cat" command
cat > <FileName>

The above command will create the file (if not available) and then it will allow us to write the content inside it

Note: If there is any data available, that data will be overwritten with the new data, if you give one > symbol

# To see the data available inside a file
cat <FileName>

# To append the data
cat >> <FileName>

# To see the data in reverse order
tac <FileName>

# Working with "vi" command
vi is an editor in Linux
vi can create a file as well
using vi we can write the data in a file

vi <FileName>
To write the data, press "i" 
To come out of the insert mode, press "esc"
To save and quit from the file, press :wq

Note: To come out of a file without saving the data;
		:q!

# To print the number of lines available in a file
cat -n <FileName>

# To see the number of lines, number of words, number of characters in a file
wc <FileName>
